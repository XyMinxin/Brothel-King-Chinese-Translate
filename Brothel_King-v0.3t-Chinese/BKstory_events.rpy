    you "You're not making any sense    ."

    chaos "Ahem, you see, as a Daemon Prince I could have easily devoured you whole, but as a sword I am more limited in my movements. I need a wielder."

    you "No way! Why would I do that???"

    chaos "Well, if you tried to impale yourself on my hilt it wouldn't work very well, would it? Not with your puny human strength, at least..."

    you "I am not impaling myself on anything! I'm not that kind of guy!"

    chaos "It's very strange. I should have taken over your mind right now, leaving you an empty husk of yourself, ready to do my bidding."

    chaos "But it seems your mind is resisting me. And you don't even seem like you're putting in much effort."

    you "I'm not."

    chaos "I don't understand... I may be a little out of practice, but I should overcome your willpower with ease... Are you a mere mortal, peasant?"

    you "Fine. If I have no use for you then, I'll just throw you out in the junkyard."

    chaos "HA! You fool! I would soon be picked up by a random scavenger, and possess him. Then I'll come for you, and cut off your nose, ears and balls!"

    you "Okay, then I'll just take a rowboat and throw you down in the harbor. Happy?"

    chaos "What... You..."

    chaos "(Wait, being stuck in that stupid sword body for centuries... again? At the bottom of the ocean? I hate salty water, it makes me all rusty...)"

    chaos "Of course! I am very capable, believe me. But there is one thing... To replenish my power, I need to feast. And you shall help me with that."

    you "Whoah, feast on blood and souls? You want me to slay people to fill your lust?"

    chaos "Ugh, blood and souls, come on, these are much too common... No, I want something truly rare... I want virgins!"

    you "Beg your pardon?"

    chaos "Virgins, [MC.name]. Give me a virgin, and can replenish my powers fully. Give me other girls, and I can still replenish some of my powers..."

    chaos "Nothing so crude, no! I will do them no physical harm, if this is what you're asking. In fact, they might just find it... Intensely pleasurable."

    you "And other harm?"

    chaos "Well, I guess their weak mind may frail a little, but I'm sure you've seen worse..."

    you "But I don't understand. You're a sword. What do you need girls for? You don't have a..."

    you "Okay, okay..."

    chaos "So? Do you think this can be arranged? I need to replenish my powers, on a monthly basis."

    you "Well... I guess it shouldn't be too hard. After all, I am a brothel owner..."

    chaos "A brothel owner? Oh, but that's just perfect!"

    chaos "You can get me my monthly dose of sweet girls, and I can help you defend yourself among other benefits..."

    you "Well, these girls are hardly virgins, just so you know..."

    chaos "Oh well. Virgins are better, but if all you've got are loose women, so be it."

    chaos "(Nice catch, a brothel owner! He can send plenty of chicks my way, and I will hardly need to work at all! After all, how dangerous can a brothel owner's life be?)"
