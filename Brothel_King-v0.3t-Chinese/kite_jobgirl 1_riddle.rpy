    jobgirl "Hey there!"

    jobgirl "Looking for another quest? I noticed you come here often, you must be a busy adventurer!"

    you "Err, not exactly. The quests are not really for me; I have a group of, hem, workers, sometimes I get a job request here for one of them."

    jobgirl "Oh, really? I could have sworn you were the adventurous type of guy..."

    you "Well, I can assure you that my life is not lacking in adventures at all! *wink*"

    jobgirl "Ahah! Well, at least you have a sense of humor. So, which kind of job are you looking for your subordinates?"

    you "Sorry but... It's private business. We don't even know each other!"

    jobgirl "Oh sure, sorry I forgot to introduce myself... Call me Scarlet."

    you "Scarlet?"

    $ jobgirl_name = "斯卡莱特"

    jobgirl "Yeah, it's my battle name. We adventurers must defend our true identities to prevent the evil we fight from harming our beloved ones..."

    jobgirl "And some girls not working on the 'adventuring' side like to use fake names too, lest their dad finds out..."

    you "I'm sure they do."

    you "Well, my name is [MC.name]. Scarlet, was it? Wait, how did you come up with such a nickname? Did you get it from a fairy tale?"

    jobgirl "Hey!!!" with vpunch

    jobgirl "What's wrong with my nickname? My hair is red, so I chose 'Scarlet' as my personal battle name!"

    you "Oh. I was hoping it would come with a better story."

    jobgirl "Shut up! It's a cool name, and I like it."

    you "Ok, ok, don't get mad! I won't bug you anymore about your name."

    jobgirl "Good, and it would be even better if you promise to stop being rude in general."

    jobgirl "Do you always treat girls like that? I bet you're still single, aren't you?"

    you "Uhm, actually... Now that you mention it, I must admit I'm not into any romantic relationship. My job keeps me busy..."

    jobgirl "I see... I guess you chose your job over women, haven't you?"

    you "Well, I wouldn't say that... Women are the most important part of my trade. They need constant training and management..."

    you "A brothel doesn't run itself, you know?"

    play sound s_surprise

    jobgirl "A brothel? So you're a pimp, right?"

    you "Well..."

    jobgirl "Ahahah, that's why you cannot find a girl!"

    you "On the other hand, I do have an active sexual life, just to inform you. So many girls from which I can choose to bring in bed with me."

    jobgirl "You may feel lucky, being surrounded by so many girls, but how many of them are special to you? Are there any girls you don't want to share with clients? Special ones?"

            you "I deal with pretty girls on a daily basis, but you can guess how my job is a great obstacle for a true relationship."
            you "Some people consider slavery and whoring immoral, others just don't want to have any sort of business with a guy like me. Furthermore, I think I haven't encountered the right girl for me yet."
            you "I'd like to have a girlfriend, I'm human after all..."

            jobgirl "I see. Your feelings are sincere, I can see it. I hope you're going to find her very soon."

    you "Now, what about you? Do you have a boyfriend?"

    jobgirl "Me? Mmh, well, let's say that my job doesn't really make me an ideal homemaker."

    "You both laugh. You feel more relaxed and spend some time chatting."

    "You learn that Scarlet lives here in Zan, in a tiny house near the plaza. She spends a lot of time running short quests."

    jobgirl "Small quests are easy and don't take much time, so I do a lot of them, having more fun and less risks than doing a single, difficult one. Plus, in this way I can help more people! Isn't it perfect?"

    you "I guess so. You don't seem bored at all, always smiling around."

    "One hour passes by while your conversation with Scarlet goes on."

    you "Oh shit, I have to hurry! Sorry Scarlet, business calls. It's been cool to know you better, I hope we can meet and talk again."

    jobgirl "Sure [MC.name], I enjoyed our time together too. You know where to find me *winks*. See ya!"

    you "Hi Scarlet. That's right, I've come to see if there's any good quest for my girls. And you? What's that scroll?"

    jobgirl "Ah, this. It's a request from a client, a scholar who was trying to decipher it. I found it a few days ago and sold it to the guy, then he asked me to find a way to translate it."
    jobgirl "But I'm no scholar. I only managed to get a raw translation but it's not enough to understand its meaning!"

    you "A scroll, uh?"

    jobgirl "Yeah, an ancient one. The more I try to figure out what's written on it, the more my head hurts!"
