### GENERIC AND CUSTOM DIALOGUE ###
###################################

## All girl dialogues are stored as Dialogue objects, in the dialogue dictionary. The dictionary is accessed with the 'get_dialogue()' method from the Girl object.
## Special syntax (temp), used only for dialogues: gname, MCname, ...


## Dialogue labels ##

label dialogue(char, topic, key="generic", custom_arg=False, nw=False, narrator_mode=False): # for Girl objects only. custom_arg is broken for now
    # In narrator_mode, dialogue will be said by the narrator instead of the girl char
    if isinstance(char, Girl):
        $ char.say(topic, custom_arg=custom_arg, nw=nw, narrator_mode=narrator_mode) # No key is provided for girls, it is instead generated according to personality and other filters
    else:
        $ pick_dialogue(topic, key=key).say(char, nw=nw)
    return


label dialogue_say_multiple(char, lines): # Where char is a renpy Character object (doesn't have to be a Girl)

    $ _lines = list(lines)

    while _lines:
        $ line = _lines.pop(0)

        if line.startswith("g: "):
            $ line = line[3:]
            $ renpy.say(char, __(line))
        elif line.startswith("mc: "):
            $ line = line[4:]
            $ renpy.say(you, __(line))
        elif line.startswith("giz: "):
            $ line = line[4:]
            $ renpy.say(gizel, __(line))
