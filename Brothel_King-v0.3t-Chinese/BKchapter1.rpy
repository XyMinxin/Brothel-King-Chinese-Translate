    sergeant "I killed a nobleman back there, which is a terrible offense. But the city guard here provided me with shelter, and a
              new family, so to speak."

    sergeant "The captain took care of me and I grew to become a trusted confidant... But I was never promoted from sergeant, because
              I needed to keep an eye on the men."

    sergeant "Instead, that up and coming lieutenant slut grew to become her second in command... Pretending to be the captain's pet.
              But I knew I was the one that the captain really trusted."

    you "What kind of assignments did you carry out for the captain?"

    sergeant "Assassinations, robberies, extortion, phony arrests... You name it. The captain had a precise plan to take over the slums, and do away
              with anyone who opposed the Guard."

    sergeant "We also took requests from powerful citizens, in exchange for money."

    sergeant "That's how we got the order to take you out... Some rich business owner in town wanted you dead... He also wanted your slave for
              some reason, if I remember correctly. So he hired the Guard's help to get rid of you."

    sergeant "Oh, it doesn't. But one thing the captain can't resist is the lust for more gold."

    you "So... Do you have any hard evidence that implicates the captain?"

              did it. Protect the last link of the chain."
