                        suzume "Her tenacity was legendary even before she became a Kunoichi. She became the leader of her school after her Master was brutally murdered, or something. Saved the whole School from extinction."

                        suzume "She set an example for her pupils to follow - and even beyond. People in my school were sharing snippets of her wisdom with each other."

                        suzume "As a spy and an assassin, she has no equal when infiltrating even the most well-defended strongholds, coming and going without anyone noticing. They call her 'The Water Ghost'."

                        suzume "She only picks a handful of contracts a year, if any. Some say she's following her own agenda."

                        suzume "But she is very sought after. She is so good at blending in that no one knows what she really looks like. I guess no one suspects an old lady."

                        suzume "Others say she's a powerful witch, and doesn't age... Which would explain why her mastery of water magic is second to none."

                        suzume "The current Kunoichi is the descendent of a long line of ninja warriors, going back all the way to the legendary couple, Ayame and Rikimaru..."

                        suzume "She's said to be the youngest Kunoichi in the history of any school, ever! She became a ninja at age six, and a Kunoichi at twelve."

                        suzume normal "The Void School is a very peculiar school. They teach no magic, instead focusing on physical feats, speed, and secret techniques. People say Void ninjas move so fast, you can only see their shadows."

                        suzume "Their Kunoichi is just a teenager, but already she's said to be one of the most accomplished Kunoichi in history. Not only that, but she won several 'Ninja Idol' contests."

                        suzume doubt "Because she's just a little younger, I was constantly compared to her when I was training - always falling short of the milestones she set."

                        suzume "Well, it's true that I wasn't very focused... But it's not my fault! There were birdies to chase after. Meow..."

                "Duchess" "A distant cousin of the ruling family, he was too young and unimportant at the time of the purge. And now, it's too late for King Pharo to correct this particular mistake... Not that he has the backbone anymore."

                you "The purge?"

                "Duchess" "Why, yes, has no one told you how the current dynasty came to power? There was a lot of bloodshed when King Pharo took the throne..."

                "Duchess" "Like all of the Magic Guild, they remained neutral during the upheaval, so they got through the change of dynasty unscathed."

                "Duchess" "And this is Lord Kosmo the Elder. He is probably the richest man in this room, although many despise him for how he made his fortune. There's no business too dirty for this man."

                you "Kosmo, you say?"

                "Duchess" "Yes. Not an old or respected name by any means, but money commands its own loyalty."

                "Duchess" "I hear his only son is acting up... Too bad, because he had plans for him. He thinks he could forge an alliance with the King..."

                you "An alliance? How?"

                "Duchess" "Why, marriage of course!"

                "Duchess" "The Princess is only the most coveted bachelorette in all of Xeros..."

                "Duchess" "But whichever fool ends up marrying her is in for a disappointment."

                you "What do you mean?"

                "She chuckles again."

                "Duchess" "Well, for starters, this girl Kurohime is likely to be as boring a bride as you could imagine... I know a frigid dove when I see one!"

                "Duchess" "I wasn't anything like her in my day... *wink*"

                "She has a worrysome glint in her eye, and you hope the old hag is not going to move on you."

                "Duchess" "But this is nothing worth mentioning. Only the plebs marry for lust or love."

                "Duchess" "What I meant is, whoever ends up marrying her is unlikely to keep the spoils for very long..."

                you "Why?"

                "Duchess" "Well, some say the Pharo dynasty will not survive its first King. Besides..."

                "She spots a knight walking towards you, and interrupts herself."

                "Duchess" "But look, my young lad, it was a pleasure talking to you. Now, I really need to talk to Lady Foozia about her new gardening book..."
